Your directory should look like:
./run_tests.sh
./tests 		---------> This is the folder you got from us
./part1		---------> This is the folder you submitted inside the zip
./part2		---------> This is the folder you submitted inside the zip


Now run run_tests.sh (maybe need to do chmod +x run_tests.sh before the first run)
